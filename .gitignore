# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
# You will want users to get their own gem files versus packaging them
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
#Uploading your database files would lead to information compromise
# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
